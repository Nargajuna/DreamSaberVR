Google Daydream VR Port WIP does not work ATM


## NOTES!

One song comes with the build. It will also look for songs in your BeatOnData folder. So it might just magically find your custom songs. If not, you will need to put songs into the android data folder: /storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.quest.opensabervr/files/Playlists

# Open Saber VR

Open Saber VR is an open source clone of the famous and fabolous game Beat Saber. 

I started this project by accident and managed to get the main game logic up and running in 3 days.  Thanks to the open source project beatsaver viewer I was able to get the blocks (notes) in sync with the beat!

Now you would maybe ask yourself what is a Beat Saber clone without any music? Yeah, you are right, it's nothing. But I have some vey good answer to this. Because of the great and wide community of the Beat Saber modders and there custom songs, you can use ANY song from their website and it will work in Open Saber VR. So just go to their websites [BeatSaver](https://beatsaver.com), [BeastSaber](https://bsaber.com) and download any song you want.

At the moment Open Saber VR only supports the notes (beat blocks) and obstacles. Mines are not supported but will be added in the future. Also a global highscore was introduced, this is in very early alpha state and the highscore itself can be deleted/changed/resetted anytime during the alpha stage.

If you are interested in helping/contributing to the project (no matter if you are a coding monkey or 3D artist or just have some ideas), feel free to contact me, I will be more than happy to have some help. You can find the complete source code here, so if you want to contribute, just have a look there.
